  <div class="About me">

    1. About me</h2>

   <p>To describe myself, I would say that I am a chill person. I am also rather demanding of myself, I like when everything is well done. Sometimes it is not and I have to accept it. When I am working, I used to listen music to focus. I want to know my qualities and my faults to improve my skills. Besides school, I love playing music, video games and tennis. These 3 things are my passions and I find them very cool.

<div class="My Objectives">

3. My objectives</h3>
<p> During the five years at IÃ‰SEG I want to improve my skills in management. If I have the choice, I would like to go a Scandinavian country beacause I like their life train and I don't like the heat;). My goal is to be a finance manager beacause I enjoy maths a lot and I want to see some figures in my future job. 


<div class="My program">
	4. My project</h4>
	<p> During the next five years in PGE, I hope I will learn a whole of things that will bring me the keys to success professionally. This year, the subjects are still very wide, which allows me to learn, relearn and learn to learn. At the moment, my favorites subjects are maths, macroeconomics and microeconomics. Maybe that's why I want to go further, for instance in finance.
